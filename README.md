**problem with video link**

I was having problems getting the audio to play with the video and the large file size. I even tried to change format from .mkv to .mp4. Google drive took too long to upload and tried YouTube. I thought YouTube would be a solution; however, I ran into the same problems. Finally, after working with Clipchanp, i was about to find a solution to change the quality of video and one of the video versions finally completed the task. All came down to my internet being slow to upload the video. I gain access to a faster internet at a friendâ€™s home.
